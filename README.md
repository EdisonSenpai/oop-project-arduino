# OOP Arduino Project 

The project consists of an addressable LED strip that can be programmed in Arduino IDE with the help of an Arduino NANO R3 board. I use a Fast Fourier Transform to filter the audio so that it only responds to voice commands, music or clapping. To provide safety, I also used a 1000uF capacitor. The connection is made through the serial port.

Later I will come with the electrical diagram.
